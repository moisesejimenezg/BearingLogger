# BearingLogger
Basic Android application intended for testing the statistical characteristics of bearing measurements generated by an Android Smartphone.

This application allows you to perform logging of both bearing (using magnetic field sensors and accelerometers) and step detection (using Google's Activity
Recognition API). Bearing data can be filtered with a Moving Average filter of up to a 100 taps.
